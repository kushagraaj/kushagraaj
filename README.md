### Hey 

I'm a first-year Computer Science student passionate about building a deep understanding of software and technology. Currently focused on honing my problem-solving skills and exploring core computer science fundamentals. I believe in learning by building. Always open to connecting with fellow developers and enthusiasts. Feel free to toss me an email **[hi@kushagraraj.me](mailto:hi@kushagraraj.me)** to talk tech or collaborate on a project. You can find my socials floating around somewhere on [kushagraraj.me](https://kushagraraj.me).
